## Data 512A Au 20: Final Project Proposal - A case analysis on 911 Calls

## Abstract 

The 911 system was designed to provide a universal, easy-to-remember number for people to reach police, fire or emergency medical assistance from any phone in any location, without having to look up specific phone numbers. In 1966, the National Academy of Sciences published "[Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society](https://www.ems.gov/pdf/1997-Reproduction-AccidentalDeathDissability.pdf),” a landmark report highlighting how accidental death and injury, particularly from motor vehicle crashes, had become an epidemic in the U.S. The report urged a series of steps to reduce these needless deaths and injuries, including exploring the “feasibility of designating a single, nationwide, telephone number to summon an ambulance”  which resulted in the inception of 911 system. This final project aims at analyzing the dataset to better understand the frequency and the top reasons contributing to the emergencies and determine whether the emergency response team is well equipped to deal with such emergencies. 


## Data used

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the City of Cincinnati's computer aided dispatch (CAD) database which contains fire incident responses including emergency medical services (EMS) calls, fires, rescue incidents, and all other services handled by the Fire Department. This dataset contains emergency call data from 1/1/2015 and is updated daily. The dataset is available as a public domain which allows to freely share and use the data for any purpose and without any restrictions.
